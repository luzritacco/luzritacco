**I am Luz Mireya Ritacco** I have always been passionate about engineering and technology. I am from Colombia and after immigrating to the U.S.A I studied and graduated from NJIT with a **B.S in Electrical and Computer Engineering Technology** and then a **Master’s in Engineering Management**. But I also had another dream: to have a family. I met my husband when I was at school, and we got married soon after graduation. We decided to have children, and I was blessed with three beautiful kids: two boys and a girl. They are the joy of my life and the reason I keep pushing limits and pursuing my dreams.

After achieving my goals of gaining my degrees and having a family, my next goal is to go back to a professional role, I 'm pursuing a **Bootcamp in cybersecurity at The Knowledge House** because I have found a strong passion for this field. This reflects my enthusiasm for constantly learning new things and finding new challenges. I think I can be a role model for other women like me who paused their professional career to raise a family and now are back with full energy and a lifelong learning spirit. I believe it is never too late to start over and pursue your passion and new aspirations.

My experience at TKH has prepared me well for the challenges and opportunities in the cybersecurity field. I have learned valuable skills and knowledge that will help me succeed in this career path. I am confident and eager to pursue my new role as a cybersecurity professional.
