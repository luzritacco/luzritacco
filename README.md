**I am Luz Mireya Ritacco** I have always been passionate about engineering and technology. I am from Colombia and after immigrating to the U.S.A I studied and graduated from NJIT with a **B.S in Electrical and Computer Engineering Technology** and then a **master‚Äôs in engineering management**. But I also had another dream: to have a family. I met my husband when I was at school, and we got married soon after graduation. We decided to have children, and I was blessed with three beautiful kids: two boys and a girl. They are the joy of my life and the reason I keep pushing limits and pursuing my dreams.


	After achieving my goals of gaining my degrees and having a family, my next goal is to go back to a professional role, I 'm pursuing a **bootcamp in cybersecurity at The Knowledge House** because I have found a strong passion for this field. This reflects my enthusiasm for constantly learning new things and finding new challenges. I think I can be a role model for other women like me who paused their professional career to raise a family and now are back with full energy and a lifelong learning spirit. I believe it is never too late to start over and pursue your passion and new aspirations.


##
My experience at TKH has prepared me well for the challenges and opportunities in the cybersecurity field. I have learned valuable skills and knowledge that will help me succeed in this career path. I am confident and eager to pursue my new role as a cybersecurity professional.
